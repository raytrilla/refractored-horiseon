# Challenge 1: Code refractor - Horiseon Website
A website refractor project for a digital marketing agency called 'Horiseon'
The aim of this challenge is to refractor the website's codebase, making sure that it follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines.

# Updating HTML to semantic elements
Upon my initial inspection of the code, I noticed that it lacked semantic elements, relying heavily on non-semantic div elements for structure. In response, I undertook a comprehensive update, substituting all divs with appropriate semantic elements such as header, footer, section, article, and aside. This adjustment enhances the code's readability, organisation, and adherence to best practices for web development.

# Ensuring HTML elements follow a logical structure
All elements seem to be in the correct sequence, aligning well with the overall styling of the web page. I added on some labelling to make finding sections of the HTML & CSS easier.

# Adding accessible alt attributes to image elements
I identified images within the source code and incorporated 'alt=' attributes for each image, providing a descriptive element to enhance accessibility and understanding.

# Find and verify the title element has a concise, descriptive title
Updated the title element to 'Horiseon Website'. This title is clear what it is and who it's for.
